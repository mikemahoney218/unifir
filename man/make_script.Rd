\title{Create an empty unifir_script object.}
\usage{
make_script(
  project,
  script_name = NULL,
  scene_name = NULL,
  unity = find_unity(),
  initialize_project = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{The directory path of the Unity project.}

\item{script_name}{The file name to save the script at. The folder location
and file extensions will be added automatically.}

\item{scene_name}{The default scene to operate within. If a function requires
a scene name and one is not provided, this field will be used.}

\item{unity}{The location of the Unity executable to create projects with.}

\item{initialize_project}{If TRUE, will call [create_unity_project] to create
a Unity project at `project`. If FALSE, will not create a new project.
If NULL, will create a new project if `project` does not exist.}
}
\description{
unifir relies upon "script" objects, which collect "prop" objects
(C# methods)
which then may be executed within a Unity project via the [action] function.
}
\examples{
# Create an empty script file
# In practice, you'll want to set `project` to the project path to create
# and `unity` to `NULL` (the default)
make_script(project = waiver(), unity = waiver())
