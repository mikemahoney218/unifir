be relative to the Unity project root directory, and likely begins with
"Assets".}

in. Ignored if NULL, the default.}

\item{x_position, y_position, z_position}{The position of the GameObject in
world space.}

\item{x_scale, y_scale, z_scale}{The scale of the GameObject (relative to its
parent object).}

\item{x_rotation, y_rotation, z_rotation}{The rotation of the GameObject to
create, as Euler angles.}

\item{exec}{Logical: Should the C# method be included in the set executed by
