unifir is a unifying API for creating and managing [Unity](https://unity.com/) 
scenes directly from R (without requiring GUI interaction). Users are able to 
write natural-feeling R code to create "scripts" (C# programs) composed of 
"props" (C# methods) which produce scenes inside the Unity engine. While it is
entirely possible to create fleshed-out Unity scenes through this package, 
unifir is primarily designed around being easy to wrap in other packages, so 
that any number of packages interacting with Unity can all share a common
framework.

The first function most unifir workflows will call is `make_script`, which 
creates a "script" object. In that script, we can tell unifir things like
where we want to save our project:

```{r}
library(unifir)
script <- make_script(project = "path/to/project")
```

We can then iteratively add props to our project, building up a series of
commands that we'll execute in sequence to create a Unity scene:

```{r}
script <- add_default_player(script, x_position = 10)
script <- add_light(script)
script <- save_scene(script)
```

All of these functions are designed with the pipe in mind, letting you
easily simplify your code:

```{r}
script <- make_script(project = "path/to/project") |> 
  add_default_player(x_position = 10) |> 
  add_light() |> 
  save_scene()
```

Once all your props are set, it's time to execute the script via the 
`action` function! This function will create a new Unity project (if necessary),
write your "script" object to a C# file, and execute it inside the Unity project.

```{r eval = FALSE}
action(script)
```

Open your new project from UnityHub, open the scene you created with 
`save_scene`, and you'll see the outputs from your script right in front of you!

Right now, unifir wraps the elements of the Unity API that I've found useful in
my own work, principally focused around creating GameObjects, lights, player
controllers, and terrain surfaces. If you are interested in pieces of the API
that haven't made it into unifir yet, please open an issue or a PR!

## Installation

The easiest way to install unifir is to install it directly from R-Universe:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Enable universe(s) by mikemahoney218
options(repos = c(
  mikemahoney218 = 'https://mikemahoney218.r-universe.dev',
  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))

# Install unifir
install.packages('unifir')
```

You can also install unifir from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mikemahoney218/unifir")
```

Note that right now there is no release version of unifir; all published 
versions are considered "development" versions. While the unifir API is 
solidifying, it is not yet solid, and breaking changes may happen at any time.

While unifir can be used by itself, you'll probably want to 
[install Unity](https://unity.com/download) in order to actually make Unity 
projects.
