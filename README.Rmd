unifir is a unifying API for creating and managing Unity scenes directly from R
(without requiring GUI interaction). Users are able to write natural-feeling R
code to create "scripts" (C# programs) composed of "props" (C# methods)
which produce scenes inside the Unity engine.

In its current state, unifir is unstable, untested, and somewhat unreliable. 
We're working on it.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `unifir` from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mikemahoney218/unifir")
```
## Example

The simplest unifir programs will create new Unity projects, load and save 
scenes, and manage the state of a Unity project. For instance, to create a new
project, create a new scene in that project with the standard light and camera,
and save the scene, we'd use the following:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(unifir)

make_script("example_unifir_script") |> 
  new_scene("DefaultGameObjects", "Single") |> 
  save_scene("example_unifir_scene") |> 
  action()
```

This package also integrates with other R packages to create terrain surfaces
and game objects within scenes. This API is still unstable and mostly 
undocumented.
